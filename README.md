# MR-Denoising-with-Wider-Neural-Network
Implementing denoising of MR images with Rician noise using a wider neural network. Based on the paper "Denoising of MR images with Rician noise using a wider neural network and noise range division" by Zhang et al. Includes training, testing, and evaluation of denoising performance.
